# PHP-Geo-Location
This PHP class/package can be used to get the complete geographical information about any place around the world. By providing a name of any location in the world, it returns the full geo-data of places that matches the location that was searched for. It returns details such as the full name of a place, the zip code, the longitude and latitude, the WMO Identifier and the Magic codes, the Time Zone, the standard time zones and so on.  It can be very useful in applications or scenarios where other details about a users location needs to be automatically provided when the name of that location is provided.

Please go through the example.php file to fully understand how this class works.
